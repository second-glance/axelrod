# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Tideman and Chieruzzi
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# This strategy begins by playing Tit For Tat and then things get slightly
# complicated:
# 1. Every run of defections played by the opponent increases the number of
#    defections that this strategy retaliates with by 1.
# 2. The opponent is given a ‘fresh start’ if:
#    - it is 10 points behind this strategy
#    - and it has not just started a run of defections
#    - and it has been at least 20 rounds since the last ‘fresh start’
#    - and there are more than 10 rounds remaining in the tournament
#    - and the total number of defections differs from a 50-50 random sample
#      by at least 3.0 standard deviations.
# A ‘fresh start’ is a sequence of two cooperations followed by an
# assumption that the game has just started (everything is forgotten).
# This strategy came 2nd in Axelrod’s original tournament


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Nydegger
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# This strategy begins by playing Tit For Tat for the first 3 rounds with the
# following modifications: if it is the only strategy to cooperate in the
# first round and the only strategy to defect on the second round then it
# defects on the 3 round (despite the fact that TFT would now cooperate).
# After these first 3 rounds the next move is made depending on the previous 3
# rounds. A score is given to these rounds according to the following
# calculation:
# A = 16a_1 + 4a_2 + a_3
# Where a_i is dependent on the outcome of the previous i^th round. If both
# strategies defect, a_i = 3, if the opponent only defects: a_i = 2 and 
# finally if it is only this strategy that defects then a_i = 1 (*).
# Finally this strategy defects if and only if:
# A \in {1,6,7,17,22,23,26,29,30,31,33,38,39,45,49,54,55,58,61}

# Graaskamp
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# This strategy follows the following rules:
# 1. Play Tit For Tat for the first 50 rounds;
# 2. Defects on round 51;
# 3. Plays 5 further rounds of Tit For Tat;
# 4. A check is then made to see if the opponent is playing randomly in which
#    case it defects for the rest of the game;
# 5. The strategy also checks to see if the opponent is playing Tit For Tat or
#    another strategy from a preliminary tournament called 'Analogy'. If so it
#    plays Tit For Tat. If not it cooperates and randomly defects every 5 to
#    15 moves.
# This strategy came 9th in Axelrod's original tournament.


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Downing
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# This strategy attempts to estimate the next move of the opponent by
# estimating the probability of cooperating given that they defected (P(C|D))
# or cooperated on the previous round (P(C|C)). These probabilities are
# continuously updated during play and the strategy attempts to maximise the
# long term play. Note that the initial values are:
# P(C|C) = P(C|D) = 1/2
# This strategy came 10th in Axelrod’s original tournament.
